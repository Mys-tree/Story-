It was hard times and good times flowing like a mountain range with all the ups and downs.
Her journey had been long, full of wonder and encounters and so full of trials and tribulations.
She was old now, and though she had achieved a lot, gained much wisdom and acquired
a plethora of new skills, she had nothing. The shock of this was too much, why? Why work
and learn and achieve so much when you cannot even get a job these days as an older person.
Why oh why do people also expect you to work full time - her whole life had been full-time.
Full time mother with no father, working part time and learning full time, creating full time.
Living full time.
